# delete-release-branch.sh — the CircleCI `delete_release_branch` job: the last step of a release. Once
# the release is published to npm and tagged, the `release/vX.Y.Z` branch has done its job, and it is
# deleted so the branch list holds only releases still in progress. The extension repository runs the
# same script under the same name; the two differ only in where the version is read from.
#
# Called as `bash scripts/ci/delete-release-branch.sh` from .circleci/config.yml.
#
# Nothing is lost by the deletion: the released commit stays reachable from its tag `v<version>`. The
# branch is NOT merged anywhere — the version bump and the CHANGELOG section land on `main` through a
# pull request before the branch is cut, so the branch carries no commit `main` needs.
#
# CONTRACT: exits 0 when there is nothing to delete — the push released nothing (no tag on this
# branch's history), or the branch is already gone — and non-zero only when a released branch could not
# be deleted. A branch that released nothing is always kept. That covers the three non-releases here:
# a `-SNAPSHOT` version (never tagged, and its branch is reused for the next snapshot), a
# `[skip publish]` commit on top of a released tag, and an approval that was never given (this job then
# never runs at all).
#
# Environment:
#   REPO_SLUG      owner/repo (set by the executor in .circleci/config.yml)
#   GITHUB_TOKEN   contents:write — the same credential `publish_npm` pushes the tag with
#   CIRCLE_BRANCH  the release branch (`release/vX.Y.Z`)
#   CIRCLE_SHA1    the commit this pipeline built and released
